**Key Points**

* A client is complaining about the new feature rolled out last week, saying it's not user-friendly and is causing frustration for their employees.
* The feature in question is the new workflow approval system.
* The team has been testing the feature, but it seems that internal employees were biased towards their own workflow.
* User testing with external users is recommended to better understand the issues.
* A guide or tutorial is needed to help the client's employees navigate the new system.
* A temporary solution or workaround is needed to alleviate the client's frustration.
* The team should prioritize the guide and support for now, and then revisit the design and user testing once the immediate concerns are addressed.

* The team will prioritize the guide and support for now.
* The team will revisit the design and user testing once the immediate concerns are addressed.
