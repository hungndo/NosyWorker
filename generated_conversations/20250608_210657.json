    },
    {
      "user": "Kevin",
      "text": "What's the feature they're specifically complaining about? Is it the login process or the dashboard layout?"
    },
    {
      "user": "Sarah",
      "text": "I think it's the new workflow approval system. I've been going through the feedback emails and a few clients have mentioned it's not intuitive."
    },
    {
      "user": "Emily",
      "text": "I agree with Sarah. I've been testing it myself and I can see how it might be confusing. Maybe we should revisit the design and make some changes?"
    },
    {
      "user": "Tom",
      "text": "But didn't we user-test this feature before launch? What did our test users say about it?"
    },
    {
      "user": "Josh",
      "text": "We did user-test it, but I think we might have missed some key pain points. And to be honest, our test users were mostly internal employees, so they might have been biased towards our own workflow."
    },
    {
      "user": "Kevin",
      "text": "That's a good point, Josh. We should probably do some more user testing with external users to get a better understanding of the issues."
    },
    {
      "user": "Sarah",
      "text": "And in the meantime, can we provide some kind of workaround or temporary solution for the client? They're getting pretty frustrated."
    },
    {
      "user": "Emily",
      "text": "I can work on putting together a guide or tutorial to help them navigate the new system. Would that help?"
    },
    {
      "user": "Tom",
      "text": "That's a great idea, Emily. And maybe we can also offer some additional support or training to help them get up to speed."
    },
    {
      "user": "Josh",
      "text": "Okay, let's prioritize the guide and support for now, and then revisit the design and user testing once we've addressed the immediate concerns."
    },
    {
      "user": "Kevin",
      "text": "Agreed. And let's also make sure to communicate clearly with the client about what we're doing to address their concerns. Transparency is key here."
    },
    {
      "user": "Sarah",
      "text": "I'll work on drafting a response to the client, and Emily can work on the guide. Tom, can you look into setting up some additional support or training?"
    },
    {
      "user": "Tom",
      "text": "Sounds good. And Josh, can you keep an eye on the client's account and make sure they're not experiencing any other issues?"
    },
    {
      "user": "Josh",
      "text": "Will do. Let's keep each other updated on our progress and make sure we're all on the same page."
